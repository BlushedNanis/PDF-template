# Notebook template script

Python script that creates a PDF notebook template. The notebook is created from a CSV file with two columns: topic and pages. The topic column specifies the page's header and footer, while the pages column specifies how many pages the topic will have. There will be inner lines on every page as well. For reference, look through "output.pdf".
